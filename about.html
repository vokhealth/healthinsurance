    <h1>About V OK Health Insurance</h1>

    <p><strong>I'm Venus</strong>, the founder of V OK Insurance, where we believe that being “okay” is just the start — you deserve to be protected, prepared, and heard.</p>

    <p>After years of watching people get lost in confusing policies or overpaying for plans that didn’t fit, I made it my mission to offer something better. Not just coverage — but peace of mind. Not just a simple quote — but a relationship.</p>

    <p>That’s what V OK stands for: being very okay with your insurance, your decisions, and your future. I don’t push plans I wouldn’t choose for myself or my family. I offer free consultations to help you understand your options — no pressure, no rush.</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>💙 Health Insurance for individuals, families & small businesses</li>
      <li>💼 Private Plans with strong networks & doctor flexibility</li>
      <li>🦷 Supplemental Coverage (dental, vision, accident, income protection & more)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Whether you're a self-employed boss, a business owner building your dream, or someone who simply wants the best care at the best value — I’ve got you.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We believe health coverage should be easy to understand and even easier to access. Our mission is to simplify the insurance process and make sure you walk away confident in your choices — without hidden costs or surprises.</p>
