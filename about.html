    <h1>About V OK Health Insurance</h1>
    <p>I'm Venus, the founder of V OK Insurance, where we believe that being “okay” is just the start — you deserve to be protected, prepared, and heard.
After years of watching people get lost in confusing policies or overpaying for plans that didn’t fit, I made it my mission to offer something better. Not just coverage — but peace of mind. Not just a simple quote — but a relationship. That’s what V OK stands for: being very okay with your insurance, your decisions, and your future. I don’t push plans I wouldn’t choose for myself or my family. I offer free consultations to help you understand your options — no pressure, no rush. 
What We Do
We specialize in:
Health Insurance for individuals, families & small businesses
Private Plans with strong networks & doctor flexibility
Supplemental Coverage (dental, vision, accident, income protection & more)
Whether you're a self-employed boss, a business owner building your dream, or someone who simply wants the best care at the best value — I’ve got you.</p>
