    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <button class="collapsible">What is Medi-Share?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Medi-Share is a healthcare sharing ministry where members share medical costs among each other. It’s not traditional insurance but can be a cost-effective alternative for some.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What’s the difference between HMO and PPO?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>HMO plans require you to use doctors within a network and get referrals for specialists, which often means lower costs. PPO plans offer more flexibility to see out-of-network providers but usually at higher costs.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">When is Open Enrollment?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Open Enrollment is the yearly period when you can sign up for or change your health insurance plan without needing a qualifying event. It usually runs from November 1 to December 15.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is a Special Enrollment Period?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A Special Enrollment Period is a limited time outside Open Enrollment when you can sign up or change plans due to qualifying life events like marriage, birth of a child, or loss of other coverage.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">How do I know if I qualify for subsidies?</button>
    <div class="content">

    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Can I keep my current doctors?</button>
