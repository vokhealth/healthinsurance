      <button class="collapsible">What is Medi-Share?</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Medi-Share is a health care sharing ministry where members share medical expenses with one another instead of using traditional insurance. It's faith-based and can be a lower-cost alternative but comes with some limitations.</p>

      <button class="collapsible">What is the difference between HMO and PPO?</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) plans usually require you to see doctors within a network and get referrals for specialists. PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) plans offer more flexibility to see out-of-network providers but usually at higher cost.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="collapsible">What is Open Enrollment?</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Open Enrollment is a yearly period when anyone can sign up for or change health insurance plans. Outside this window, you typically can only enroll if you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="collapsible">What is a Special Enrollment Period?</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>A Special Enrollment Period allows you to sign up for health insurance outside of Open Enrollment if you experience qualifying life events like marriage, birth of a child, loss of other coverage, or moving to a new area.</p>
